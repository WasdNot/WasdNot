I'm currently pursuing a degree in Electronic Engineering in Universidad Tecnológica del Perú (No working). I want to discover more about the secrets of the world (that's why I'm learning electronic). However, my real passion is programming.
Programming languages that I know most are C# and Java. Also I know a bit about Python and HTML, Javascript and PHP.
